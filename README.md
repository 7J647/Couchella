# project-1: "COUCHELLA"

## Introduction 

As developers we are all part of a community and most projects whether individual or collaborative inside an organization involve working together with or seeking guidance from others to achieve the project goal.  This "project-1" of the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Full-Time Coding program is our first opportunity to work together with our peers to achieve a project's requirements within given restraints.

The application goals of this project were as follows:
    1) We had to use at least two server-side APIs, at least one of which had yet to be introduced during class.
    2) Though not absolutely mandatory we were encouraged to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
    3) The app had to be interactive, meaning it accepted and responded to user input.
    4) The UI must be polished.
    5) Coding must meet accepted standards for good quality.
    6) No use of alerts, confirms, or prompts
    7) App to be deployed to GitHub pages

## Description

The idea for this project came somewhat from the 2020 pandemic and the fact that it has made it nearly impossible for concert-goers and music enthusiasts to attend live shows.  However even in the best of times there are many people who have barriers in their way that prevent them from attending as many concerts as they would otherwise like.

With so many concerts being filmed in HD and 4K video these music enthusiasts would enjoy being able to relax on their couch and watch some great concerts from the comfort of home, without having to sit at their desks and putting in the work searching YouTube and choosing which concerts they should watch. Our app has picked the best concerts so that all a user has to do is open the app, pick a genre, and then an artist.  A concert is then recommended and the user just hits play to begin.  Couchella is an app that allows someone who feels like watching a concert to easily do so while knowing that the content has already been vetted as being worthy of viewing.

What makes the project stand out is that it grabs a user's attention right from the start.  A background image was chosen that sets the stage perfectly.  A short, to the point trademarked phrase--"We bring the show to you"--communicates immediately what the app provides to the user.  A clear and obvious call to action starts the process.

We learned a lot in this project from new CSS tricks to working with new APIs but the main lesson was simply how to put together everything taught to us thus far in the program and learning how to use GitHub as a group.

## Features

This website features the use of CSS that appeals to the target demographic which is basically music enthusiasts between the ages of 18-35 roughly.  The colors were purposely chosen grab a user's attention in a positive way that conveys the atmosphere of a major concert.  Buttons were styled with icons, the use of animation and wave effects, and color changes for different listening events.  One API call brings in a chosen YouTube video and another API call to TasteDive brings in a list of similar artists.  All of this is achieved on just one HTML page.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.
