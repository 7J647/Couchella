# project-1

## Description 

As developers we are all part of a community and most projects whether individual or collaborative inside an organization involve working together with or seeking guidance from others to achieve the project goal.  This "project-1" of the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Full-Time Coding program is our first opportunity to work together with our peers to achieve a project's requirements within given restraints.

The application goals of this project were as follows:
    1) We had to use at least two server-side APIs, at least one of which had yet to be introduced during class.
    2) Though not absolutely mandatory we were encouraged to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
    3) The app had to be interactive, meaning it accepted and responded to user input.
    4) The UI must be polished.
    5) Coding must meet accepted standards for good quality.
    6) No use of alerts, confirms, or prompts
    7) App to be deployed to GitHub pages
